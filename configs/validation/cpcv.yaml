# Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV) Configuration
#
# Implements López de Prado's Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation:
# - Partitions data into N temporal groups
# - Generates folds by selecting k groups as test (combinatorial)
# - Allows training on data before and after test (unlike walk-forward)
# - Applies purging to remove overlapping labels
# - Applies embargo after each test block

validation:
  cv_type: "cpcv"  # Use CombinatorialPurgedCV
  
  # CPCV parameters
  n_groups: 10  # Number of temporal groups (blocks) to partition the series
  n_test_groups: 2  # Number of groups used as test for each fold (k)
  
  # Embargo
  embargo_duration: 20  # Size of embargo (in bars) after each test block
  
  # Optional: Limit number of combinations if C(n_groups, n_test_groups) is too large
  # If None, uses all combinations
  max_combinations: null  # e.g., 45 to limit to 45 folds max
