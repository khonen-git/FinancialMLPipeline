# Simple Time-Series Cross-Validation Configuration
#
# Baseline CV method: wrapper around sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit with optional gap.
# This serves as a benchmark to compare against CPCV (Combinatorial Purged CV).
#
# Unlike CPCV, this method:
# - Does not perform purging based on label intervals
# - Does not apply embargo
# - Simply splits data temporally with an optional gap between train and test

validation:
  cv_type: "time_series"  # Use TimeSeriesCV (baseline sklearn-based)
  
  # Parameters
  n_splits: 3  # Number of CV folds
  test_size: 2000  # Number of samples in each test set (optional, if None uses sklearn default)
  gap: 0  # Number of samples to skip between train and test sets
